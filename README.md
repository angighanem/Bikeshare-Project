# Bikeshare-Project
Exploration of Bikeshare Dataset using Python-pandas

## Overview 
The main aim of this project is to: 
  - create functions, loops, conditional statements, time methods
  - handle raw data input from users
  - using Docstrings and good coding practices
  - answer descriptive analytics questions about the data
